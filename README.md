# üßÆ Student Scores Analyzer

This project processes student scores for Math and Science, calculates their average scores, and identifies the top-performing student.

---

## üìÇ Files

- `1.py` ‚Äì Python script that handles data processing and analysis.
- `main.go` ‚Äì Go-based compiler that detects file types and executes Python code.

## üêç Python Execution

Run using the standard Python 3 interpreter:

```bash
time python3 1.py


## Output
Student Scores:

      Name  Math Score  Science Score  Average Score
0    Alice          85             88           86.5
1      Bob          90             76           83.0
2  Charlie          78             93           85.5
3    David          92             85           88.5

Execution time
Execution Time: 452.751291ms


## üìä Performance Comparison

| Method             | Total Execution Time |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Python Interpreter | 745 ms               |
| Go-Based Compiler  | ~453 ms              |

The **Go-based compiler** approach shows improved execution time when handling the same Python code.
